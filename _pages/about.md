Upcoming cosmological surveys have the potential to 
reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts 
such as the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation. 
However, most of the key science goals require the joint 
analysis of multiple datasets to break parameter 
degeneracies and calibrate systematics. To realize such 
analyses, a large set of simulations that models the 
realistic observables in a correlated manner is required. 
Here, we present the HalfDome cosmological simulations, 
a set of large-volume medium-resolution simulations 
designed specifically for the joint analysis of Stage IV 
cosmological surveys, such as Rubin LSST, Euclid, 
SPHEREx, Roman, DESI, PFS, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, 
and LiteBIRD. Our full-resolution runs ($6144^3$ 
particles, $3750$ $\mathrm{Mpc}/h$ box) reach a minimal 
halo mass of $\sim 10^{12}$ $M_\odot \, h^{-1}$ and 
resolution $k \sim 1\,h\; {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. They cover 
the full spherical volume between $z$=0--4. Our data 
release of $\approx$300TB data includes the particle 
and halo lightcones of 11 realizations and an additional 
run with primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}$=20.
