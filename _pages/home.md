Upcoming cosmological surveys have the potential to 
reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts 
such as the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation. 
However, most of the key science goals require the joint 
analysis of multiple datasets to break parameter 
degeneracies and calibrate systematics. To realize such 
analyses, a large set of simulations that models the 
realistic observables in a correlated manner is required. 

We are a diverse team of practitioners in the worlds of the 
CMB, LSS, and Machine Learning set on simulating the Universe
to enable the joint analysis of Stage IV 
cosmological surveys, such as Rubin LSST, Euclid, 
SPHEREx, Roman, DESI, PFS, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, 
and LiteBIRD.
