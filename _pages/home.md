The HalfDome Cosmological Simulations are tailored to 
the joint analysis of ongoing and upcoming cosmological 
surveys such as [DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/), 
[PFS](https://pfs.ipmu.jp/), [Rubin LSST](https://www.lsst.org/), 
[Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid),
[SPHEREx](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/spherex), 
[Roman](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/), 
[Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/), 
[CMB-S4](https://cmb-s4.org/),
and [LiteBIRD](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/future/litebird.html). 
We are a diverse team of experts in the worlds of the
cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, numerical simulations, 
and machine learning.

Upcoming cosmological surveys have the potential to
reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts
such as the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation.
However, most of the key science goals require the joint
analysis of multiple datasets to break parameter
degeneracies and calibrate systematics. The HalfDome simulations, 
a large set of simulations that models the
multi-wavelength observables in a correlated manner, 
are designed to realize such analyses.

We plan to release our simulations and codes to the public. 
If you are interested in collaborating with us,
