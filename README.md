# [HalfDome Cosmological Simulations](https://halfdomesims.github.io/)

<img src="/assets/images/logo_small.png" style="width: 200px;">

The HalfDome Cosmological Simulations ([https://halfdomesims.github.io/](https://halfdomesims.github.io/)) are tailored to 
the joint analysis of ongoing and upcoming cosmological 
surveys such as [DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/), 
[PFS](https://pfs.ipmu.jp/), [Rubin LSST](https://www.lsst.org/), 
[Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid),
[SPHEREx](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/spherex), 
[Roman](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/), 
[Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/), 
[CMB-S4](https://cmb-s4.org/),
and [LiteBIRD](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/future/litebird.html). 
These surveys have the potential to
reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts
such as the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation.
However, these key science goals require the joint
analysis of multiple datasets to break parameter
degeneracies and calibrate systematics. 
By modeling the multi-wavelength observables in a correlated manner, 
our simulations are designed to enable such analyses.

We are a diverse [team](https://halfdomesims.github.io/team/) of 
experts in the worlds of the cosmic microwave background, 
large-scale structure, numerical simulations, 
and machine learning. 
We plan to release our simulations and codes to the public, with continued future updates.
