Upcoming cosmological surveys have the potential to
reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts
such as the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation.
However, most of the key science goals require the joint
analysis of multiple datasets to break parameter
degeneracies and calibrate systematics. To realize such
analyses, a large set of simulations that models the
realistic observables in a correlated manner is required.

We are a diverse team of practitioners in the worlds of the
CMB, LSS, and Machine Learning set on simulating the Universe
to enable the joint analysis of Stage IV
cosmological surveys, such as Rubin LSST, Euclid,
SPHEREx, Roman, DESI, PFS, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4,
and LiteBIRD.
